# Introduction
I made this module so that school students can just yoink some of the code for their projects / assignments.
They are rather basic projects but that's what we have to do in my school so YES.

# Note
- The code have proper commenting.
- The code is just basic java, so it shold be good enough for school projects.

## Requests
If you want me to add a different project than just create an issue and provide information about what i have to make.
